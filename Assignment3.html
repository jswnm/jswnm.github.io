            <h1>Video Game Sales Visualization</h1>

            <section>
              <h2>Dataset Description</h2>

              <p>
                This dataset contains historical video game sales data across multiple gaming
                platforms, genres, publishers, and global regions. Each row represents a
                video game and records how many millions of units it sold in North America,
                Europe, Japan, and other regions, along with its total global sales.
              </p>

              <h3>Variables and Data Types</h3>
              <ul>
                <li><strong>Name</strong> – Categorical: Title of the video game.</li>
                <li><strong>Platform</strong> – Categorical: Console/system the game was released on (e.g., Wii, PS2).</li>
                <li><strong>Year</strong> – Temporal/Ordinal: Release year of the game.</li>
                <li><strong>Genre</strong> – Categorical: Type of game such as Action, Sports, RPG.</li>
                <li><strong>Publisher</strong> – Categorical: Company that published the game.</li>
                <li><strong>NA_Sales, EU_Sales, JP_Sales, Other_Sales</strong> – Quantitative: Regional sales in millions.</li>
                <li><strong>Global_Sales</strong> – Quantitative: Total worldwide sales.</li>
              </ul>

              <h3>Key Observations</h3>
              <p>
                The dataset is highly skewed, meaning that while many games sell small
                amounts, a small number of blockbuster titles generate extremely high sales.
                Genres like Action and Sports appear most frequently, and long-lasting
                platforms such as PlayStation and Nintendo systems contribute significantly
                to total global sales. This reflects the “hit-driven” nature of the gaming
                industry where a few successful titles dominate the market.

              <h2>Visualization 1: Global Sales by Genre and Platform</h2>

              <p><strong>Questions:</strong></p>
              <ul>
                <li>Which genres generate the highest global sales overall?</li>
                <li>Are certain platforms strongly associated with specific genres?</li>
              </ul>

              <div class="viz-section">
                <div class="viz-container">
                  <div id="view1"></div>
                </div>
              </div>

              <p><strong>Reflection:</strong>
                Action, sports, and shooter genres consistently produce the largest share of
                global sales. Popular platforms repeatedly appear within these genres,
                suggesting that successful hardware ecosystems help amplify genre success.
                This shows how platform adoption and content type reinforce each other.
              </p>

              <p><strong>Design Choice:</strong>
                A bar chart allows clear comparison of totals while color encoding reveals
                platform contribution without overwhelming the viewer.
              </p>

            <section>
              <h2>Visualization 2: Sales Over Time by Platform and Genre</h2>

              <p><strong>Questions:</strong></p>
              <ul>
                <li>How have video game sales changed across different console generations?</li>
                <li>Do platforms follow predictable life cycles?</li>
              </ul>

              <div class="viz-section">
                <div class="viz-container">
                  <div id="view2"></div>
                </div>
              </div>

              <p><strong>Reflection:</strong>
                Sales patterns show clear rises and declines corresponding to console
                generations. Platforms peak several years after release and then taper off
                as newer systems enter the market, illustrating the cyclical innovation
                pattern of the gaming industry.
              </p>

              <p><strong>Design Choice:</strong>
                A line chart is ideal for showing change over time and highlighting growth,
                peak, and decline phases.
              </p>

            <section>
              <h2>Visualization 3: Regional Sales vs. Platform</h2>

              <p><strong>Questions:</strong></p>
              <ul>
                <li>Do players in different regions prefer different platforms?</li>
                <li>Which platforms are strongest in North America, Europe, and Japan?</li>
              </ul>

              <div class="viz-section">
                <div class="viz-container">
                  <div id="view3"></div>
                </div>
              </div>

              <p><strong>Reflection:</strong>
                Regional variation is clear: some platforms perform far better in specific
                markets, reflecting cultural familiarity, localization, and historical brand
                presence. Japan shows different preferences compared to Western markets.
              </p>

              <p><strong>Design Choice:</strong>
                Grouped bars allow direct comparison between regions while maintaining
                platform-level detail.
              </p>

              <h2>Visualization 4: Visual Story — Market Concentration of Publishers</h2>

              <p><strong>Questions:</strong></p>
              <ul>
                <li>Is the video game industry dominated by a small number of publishers?</li>
                <li>How much of total sales come from leading companies?</li>
              </ul>

              <div class="viz-section">
                <div class="viz-container">
                  <div id="view4"></div>
                </div>
              </div>

              <p><strong>Reflection:</strong>
                A small group of major publishers accounts for a disproportionately large
                share of global sales. This demonstrates the blockbuster economy of gaming,
                where recognizable franchises and strong marketing create repeated success.
              </p>

              <p><strong>Design Choice:</strong>
                A ranked comparison emphasizes hierarchy and makes market dominance easier
                to interpret.
              </p>
