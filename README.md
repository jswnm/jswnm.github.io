The purpose of this website is to introduce you to myself, and a little bit of what I do and what I like to do, through the showing of my work.

The technology that I used is HTML, CSS, JavaScript and drawing through SVG. I used Flexbox and rem to make the website responsive and smooth to be viewed on all devices.

The main page is the about me page, where it shows a little bit of what I do, there is a navigation bar that can take you to my projects, which is my visualizations page, and then multiple links to some of my socials. You can even double tap the header to change its look!

The website should be viewed on jswnm.github.io in the search bar. https://jswnm.github.io/
